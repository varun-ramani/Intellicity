# SafetyNet
An ML based risk management system built for PennApps 2019

Summary: SafetyNet is aimed at making our cities smarter. From the nearest trashcan to recent crimes in their vicinity, SafetyNet is able to provide users with a comprehensive, live-time view of the city around them.

What it does: SafetyNet works by leveraging the power of croudsourcing. Whenever users spot an object, event or place that fits into one of several categories, they can report it through a single button in our app. This is then relayed through our severs and others users on our app can then view this report along with any associated images or descriptions, conviently placed as a marker on a map.

Why we built it: 

Technologies used: SafetyNet was built using a variety of different frameworks and tools. Our front-end was designed using Flutter and the Google Maps API, which provided us with an efficient way to get geolocation data and place markers. Our backend was made using Flask for the server, which helped us handle and store reports.
